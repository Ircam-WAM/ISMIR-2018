# 2018 Call for sponsors

It is our great pleasure to announce the Call for Sponsors for the 19th International Society for Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR) Conference, which will take place in Paris, France from September 23-27, 2018.

## About ISMIR
The annual ISMIR conference is the world’s leading interdisciplinary forum on accessing, analyzing, and organizing music, and embraces the complexity and diversity of music by showcasing ideas and applications that enhance the human experience of music. This conference aims to foster dialogue across disciplines by bringing together researchers, developers, educators, librarians, students, and professionals.

The ISMIR 2018 conference will be held in Paris, France – City of Light and home to numerous music research centers, music technology companies, and music startups. The main conference will be located at the Cité Internationale Universitaire de Paris, a unique and emblematic location for its architecture with masterpieces from Le Corbusier and Dudok and its essential role for student housing. Along with the exciting main program that every ISMIR conference has to offer, the 2018 edition will feature, among other special events, a hackathon organised by Deezer researchers; an exhibition of art and research pieces rooted in the emerging field of interactive machine learning for music; as well as a special MeetUp with the Industry event, which will especially shed some light on the vibrant French music startup scene. Not to mention the amazing social program, including a wine and cheese welcome reception, a dinner cruise on the Seine river (accompanied with French Manouche Jazz music), and a concert/talk by a top music artist (surprise!).
